# 👻 The "Green Ghost" Index (GGI)

## 🔮 Predicting Climate Finance Corruption in Asia Using Satellite & Financial Data

**"Where does the climate funds go when it vanishes? We're looking up to find out."**

## 🚀 1. Project Objective

The **Green Ghost Index (GGI)** is a data-driven initiative to combat corruption in Asia's renewable energy sector. The core objective is to build a predictive model that identifies and forecasts the likelihood of a project becoming a **"Green Ghost."**

### Key Outputs

* **Model Performance Summary:** A machine learning-driven risk score that forecasts the probability of a future project becoming a "ghost" based on the host country's governance profile and the project's financial characteristics.
* **Live Projection Corruption Forecast:** Provides a trend diagnosis through metrics such as CPI score,WJP Rule Law.
*  **Green Ghost Index Hotlist:** Describes set of countries that are at risk of becoming a "Green Ghost" which is flagged by the satelite and provided by up to date data.

## 🛠️ 2. Methodology: A 4-Step Data-Driven Audit

This project integrates four distinct data pillars—from the promise of money to the on-the-ground reality—to create an auditable timeline.

### Step 1: Map the Money (Financial Inflows)
* **Goal:** Create a master list of all large-scale, planned green energy projects in South and Southeast Asia.
* **Datasets:** Asian Development Bank (ADB), World Bank Project Databases, and Green Climate Fund (GCF) Project Dashboard.

### Step 2: Map the Risk (Governance & Corruption)
* **Goal:** Assign a predictive corruption risk score to the country of each target project.
* **Datasets:** Transparency International (CPI) score, and World Justice Project Rule of Law Index ("Absence of Corruption" sub-factor).

### Step 3: Find the "Ghosts" (Satellite Investigation)
* **Goal:** Remotely audit the physical existence of funded projects using geospatial data.
* **Tools:** Global Energy Monitor (GEM) Trackers (for precise GPS coordinates), and **Copernicus Sentinel-2 Satellite Imagery (via Google Earth Engine)**.
* **"Ghost Sighting":** Projects listed as "in construction" since 2022 that still appear as empty fields on late-2025 satellite images are flagged.

### Step 4: Measure the Impact (The Real-World Consequence)
* **Goal:** Measure the discrepancy between funded clean energy capacity and the actual energy delivered.
* **Datasets:** Ember's Global Electricity Review (for actual MWh generated) and Our World in Data (OWID) Electricity Mix datasets.

## 📈 3. Predicted Result & Presentation

We will train a machine learning classifier  XGBoost to answer the ultimate question:

> **"If a new $100 million solar project is announced in Country X (CPI score of 35), what is the statistical probability (e.g., 65%) that it will become a 'Green Ghost'?"**

This Crystal ball named Oracle provides a critical, evidence-based tool for international funders and investors to forecast corruption risk *before* the money is committed.
